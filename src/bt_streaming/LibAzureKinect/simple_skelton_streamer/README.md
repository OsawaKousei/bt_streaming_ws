# C++ Camera Skeleton Application

This project is designed to establish a connection with a camera and process skeleton detection results. It includes the necessary components to initialize the camera, capture frames, and analyze skeleton data.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cpp-camera-skeleton-app
   ```

2. **Build the Project**
   Ensure you have a C++ compiler and CMake installed. Run the following commands:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   cmake ..
   make
   ```

3. **Run the Application**
   After building, you can run the application with:
   ```bash
   ./cpp-camera-skeleton-app
   ```

## Usage

- The application will initialize the camera and start capturing frames.
- Skeleton detection results will be processed and can be accessed through the provided callback function.

## Dependencies

- Ensure that you have the necessary libraries for camera access and skeleton detection installed. This may include specific SDKs or libraries depending on the camera hardware used.
